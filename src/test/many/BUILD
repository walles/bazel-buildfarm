Provide a simple C++ build graph as large as desired.

You may alter the values of cc_binaries(), cc_libraries(), and
cc_library_sources() via the environment variables MANY_CC_BINARIES,
MANY_CC_LIBRARIES, and MANY_CC_LIBRARY_SOURCES. For instance:

    MANY_CC_BINARIES=20 MANY_CC_LIBRARIES=10 MANY_CC_LIBRARY_SOURCES=5 bazel build //:cc
